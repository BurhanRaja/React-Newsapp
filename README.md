# NewsApp

1. Using free News API

URL:- https://newsapi.org/ 
I used the above link to get the API and Iused the data given in json format in my website NewsMonkey. 

2. State in class based components

- Here, you can use state by calling a constructor. In that constructor it is necessary to include `super()` because it will help display website or you will get an error.
- `Props` are for read-only purpose but you can change the `State`.
- You can initialize state by `this.state = { }` and set it by `this.setState`.
